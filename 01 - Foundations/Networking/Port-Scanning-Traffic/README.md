# Port Scanning Traffic Analysis – TCP SYN and RST

## Objective
To observe and analyze network traffic generated during manual port scanning and understand how scanning activity appears at the packet level.

---

## Environment
- OS: Kali Linux
- Network Interface: eth0
- IP Address: 192.168.15.129
- Target: Local Gateway (192.168.15.2)
- Tool: Wireshark
- Command Used: netcat (nc)

---

## Activity Performed
1. Identified the local gateway using:
2. Started packet capture on interface `eth0`.
3. Performed manual port scanning using netcat:
for p in 21 22 23 80 443; do
nc -zv 192.168.15.2 $p
sleep 1
done
4. Captured and analyzed TCP traffic generated by the scan.

## Observations
- TCP **SYN** packets were sent from the host to multiple destination ports.
- The gateway responded with **RST, ACK** packets.
- No TCP 3-way handshake was completed.
- Each destination port responded immediately with a connection refusal.

Observed traffic pattern:

---

## Detection Perspective
This traffic pattern is characteristic of **network service scanning**:
- Multiple SYN packets
- Multiple destination ports
- Short time window
- No established connections

Such behavior is commonly observed during reconnaissance phases of an attack.

## Evidence
- Packet Capture:
  - `port-scan-traffic.pcapng` (stored in `07-Evidences/Packet-Captures/`)
- Screenshot:
  - SYN and RST packets highlighted in Wireshark

---

## Key Learnings
- Learned how port scanning traffic appears on the wire.
- Understood the significance of SYN and RST packets in identifying closed ports.
- Gained practical insight into how Blue Teams detect reconnaissance activity.
